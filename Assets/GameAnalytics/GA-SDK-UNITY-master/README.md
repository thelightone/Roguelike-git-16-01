# GA-SDK-UNITY
GameAnalytics Unity SDK.

Documentation can be found [here](https://gameanalytics.com/docs/unity-sdk).

If you have any issues or feedback regarding the SDK, please contact our friendly support team [here](https://gameanalytics.com/contact).

This is a custom package used with [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Packages.html) if you want the usual .unitypackage you can download it [here](https://download.gameanalytics.com/unity/GA_SDK_UNITY.unitypackage).

OBS: If you want to use ILRD with the SDK and you are getting the SDK via UPM you need to download this .unitypackage [here](https://download.gameanalytics.com/unity/GA_ILRD_UNITY.unitypackage). This has to do with some dependency issues with the Ad SDKs which are not on UPM yet.
